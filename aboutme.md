I am Dinesh Sundaravadivelu Devarajan, a Ph.D. student in the Chemical Engineering department at Texas Tech University.  I employ molecular simulation techniques to investigate the molecular behavior of different complex fluid materials that can impact varied engineering sectors ranging from cosmetics and paint industries to the development of drug-delivery vehicles as well as aerospace industries.
