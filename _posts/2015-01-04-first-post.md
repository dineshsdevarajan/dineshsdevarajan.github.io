This is my first post, how exciting!        
I have created this personal webpage to document about the various research projects in the field of computational science.        
Being a machine learning (ML) enthusiast, I will also be sharing about some of the online courses and projects that I work on during this journey towards learning ML.           
Thank you Dean Attali for creating this beautiful [theme](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll).
