Excited to be writing my first post!

I have created this personal webpage to share about the various research problems that I have investigated by employing molecular simulations.

Being a machine learning (ML) enthusiast, I will also be sharing about the courses and projects that I work on during my journey towards learning ML.  

Thank you Dean Attali for creating this beautiful [theme](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll).
