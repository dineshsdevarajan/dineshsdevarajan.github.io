Excited to be writing my first post!

I have created this personal webpage to share about the various research problems that I have investigated using molecular simulations during my doctorate studies.

Being a machine learning (ML) enthusiast, I will also be sharing about the courses and projects that I work on during my journey towards learning ML. Machine learning is often considered to be a black box but with the right kind of understanding about the fundamentals, I believe that one could use it to solve problems in varied fields, in particular the ever-growing engineering applications.
