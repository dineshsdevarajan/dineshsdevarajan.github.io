<span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span>
I completed my <a target="_blank" href="DineshSDevarajan_BTech_ChemE.pdf">Bachelor's in ChemE</a> from Anna University, ACT Campus in Guindy, Chennai, India. Following that, I finished my <a href="DineshSDevarajan_MS_ChemE.pdf">Master's</a> and <a href="DineshSDevarajan_PhD_ChemE.pdf">Ph.D. in ChemE</a> under Prof. Rajesh Khare at Texas Tech University.

Currently, I am working as a Lecturer in the Edward E. Whitacre Jr. College of Engineering at Texas Tech University. I am teaching Computational Thinking with Data Science to the Engineering freshmen. Specifically, I am teaching how to handle and analyze engineering data, and get useful information out of it by employing computational thinking, basic statistical, and data science analysis using Python.

During my Ph.D., my research was focused on the development of explicit solvent (particulate) models of nanocolloidal suspensions and to study of rheology of nanocolloidal suspensions using particulate model systems. Bulk rheology and probe rheology molecular simulation techniques were utilized to investigate the suspension rheology that has applications in the design of drug-delivery vehicles. Other topics of interest included the study of atomistically-detailed systems such as the exfoliation and the stabilization mechanism of boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) in alcohol-water cosolvent mixtures, and the mechanical and the dynamical properties of highly cross-linked epoxy systems.
